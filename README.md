# Project Class Insights: Server Side

**URL** these will be updated as soon as our application is live. HERE.


Description
===
The Purpose of this project is to help the instructors increase their impact of teaching with better data analysis.
communication gap fix
Feedback mechanism introduced in this application helps the instructor to point out the exact things that he/she should change. Either in his teaching style or the curriculum itself instead of trying things in an unguided way.

Data provides feedback to the thinking process of the instructor that helps them to make data-driven decisions.

1. MongoDB - for it's free and open source nature with crosplatform and speed at it's core.Also it has it's server support for javascript.Having a unified language from frontend to backend gives advatage.
2. Express - minimal application framework that provides a set of features. Few basic functionality that every basic app needs. Instead of recreating those just use this.
3. GraphQL -prevents duplicate queries,and makes sure that we get what we want from the client's perspective.

7. morgan - used for logging request, response and related details.
8. ejs - templating language to allow reuse of the HTML with the common data that we want.
9. validator - for sanitizing the strings and making sure that nothing else gets executed.
10. dotenv - to protect our passwords and critical information to be leaked by setting up the environment variables
11. unit testing - Enzyme,jest
12. Next.js - server side rendering for react

## Client SIde
1. Apollo Client - for the interface at client with the graphql
2. Echarts - for visualisation and data representation in graphs.
3. Material-UI/Rebass
4. React
5. Redux - A state container that allows other components an easy to update interface.instead of calling the parent for the data binding the state will be direcly accessible to all the components.
